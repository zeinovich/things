# octoprimus
This code finds all prime numbers within a given limit and plots it in radial coordinates. What's interesting is prime numbers plotted like that firstly form 
spirals that on a bigger scale transform into thicker spirals which then transfrom into ray-like things going from center of coordinates.

Thx 3Blue1Brown for an idea!
